## Verification

The objective of the verification is to prove that `maxFill` satisfies a very literal formalization
of the prompt: `maxFill` computes the total number of "actions" needed to clear all wells in the
grid. Here, "actions" on individual wells are represented by the `WellAction` structure, which
provides information about how much water is removed from which columns, while maintaining that
the total amount of removed water is bounded by the capacity.

The main work consists in reducing this model to a simpler, more abstract one, where each well
only contains information about the total amount of contained water, without the distribution
of it along the columns. Consequently, actions (`AbstractWellAction`) consist solely of the total
amount of water removed. In this model, it is much easier to verify the minimal number of
actions needed.

## Prompt

```python3

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it,
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input:
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input:
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5

    Example 3:
        Input:
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10
    """
```

## Canonical solution

```python3
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
```

## Tests

```python3
def check(candidate):


    # Check some simple cases
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1) == 6, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2) == 5, "Error"
    assert candidate([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5) == 0, "Error"

    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"
    assert candidate([[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], 2) == 4, "Error"
